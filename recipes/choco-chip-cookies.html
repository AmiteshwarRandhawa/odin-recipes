    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Crispy around the edges, chewy and chocolaty in the 
        middle, and thin, oh so thin. My 'secret' formula 
        has been adapted from Alton Brown's famous,
        'The Thin' recipe, and is fairly foolproof.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, very soft</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li> 
            <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li> cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl.
                In a separate bowl, cream the butter, white sugar, and 
                brown sugar together until mixture is light and fluffy, 3 
                to 4 minutes. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla extract. 
                Whisk liquids together in small areas around the bowl, 
                then all together to avoid separation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour dry ingredients into the wet ingredients;
                 stir until flour is thoroughly mixed in. 
                 Stir in the chocolate chips.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer dough to a resealable plastic bag.
                Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 2 hours.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F 
                (190 degrees C). Line baking sheet with 
                parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scoop out rounded tablespoons of dough and place on 
                prepared baking sheet, leaving 4 inches of space between 
                cookies (about 8 per sheet). Bake in preheated oven until 
                cookies are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Slide parchment 
                and cookies onto a cooling rack for a few minutes. 
                Remove parchment and finish cooling the cookies on the rack.
            </li>
        </ol>
